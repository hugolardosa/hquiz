## HQuiz

Interactive quiz application for teachers. Includes a questionnaire editor and a presenter mode for running sessions in class.

### Project status and provenance
- All application code was generated with Cursor AI as an experiment in AI-assisted development.
- Logos/artwork were generated by Gemini.

## Features
- Editor with support for multiple question types:
  - multiple-choice
  - true-false
  - text
  - image-choice (answers are images)
- Presenter mode: start timers, mark answers as correct/incorrect, and reveal the correct answer.

- Use localStorage to save presentor view status
- macOS menu follows platform conventions (About, Services, Hide, Quit, etc.). Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl+N, Cmd/Ctrl+O, Cmd/Ctrl+S, Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+S.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended LTS)
- npm 9+

### Install
```
npm install
```

### Run in development (Vite + Electron)
```
npm run electron:dev
```
This runs Vite for the renderer and launches Electron. The app starts on the Editor by default.

### Build distributables
```
npm run build
```
This builds the renderer and packages the app via electron-builder into the `release/` directory.

Optional: Provide platform icons in `build/icons/` before packaging
- macOS: `build/icons/icon.icns`
- Windows: `build/icons/icon.ico`
- Linux: `build/icons/icon.png` (512×512)

## Using the app

### Editor
- Use File → New/Open…/Save/Save As… or the toolbar buttons.
- Title and Description fields define questionnaire metadata.
- Add questions, choose the type, set the time limit, and mark the correct answer.
- For image-choice questions, each answer is an image you select. Images are embedded as data URLs in the file for portability.

### Presenter
- Select a question in the grid to start it. The timer runs according to the question’s time limit.
- Mark the outcome (Aluno Acertou/Errou) and/or reveal the correct answer.

## Questionnaire JSON format

The application saves and loads a questionnaire as a single JSON file. Dates are serialized as ISO strings on disk and rehydrated to `Date` in the app.

Types (for reference):
```
Questionnaire {
  id: string
  title: string
  description?: string
  questions: Question[]
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

Question {
  id: string
  type: 'multiple-choice' | 'true-false' | 'text' | 'image-choice'
  question: string
  answers: string[]        // For image-choice, entries are data URLs (e.g., "data:image/png;base64,...")
  correctAnswer: number    // Index in the answers array
  timeLimit: number        // Seconds
  image?: string           // Optional image for the question prompt; data URL
}
```

Example file snippet:
```json
{
  "id": "c8a6b7b0-3b3f-4da1-8b0b-0c1c2d3e4f5a",
  "title": "Português — Vocabulário",
  "description": "Reconheça palavras pelo significado ou imagem",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Qual é o sinônimo de 'rápido'?",
      "answers": ["Lento", "Veloz", "Parado", "Curto"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "timeLimit": 60
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "image-choice",
      "question": "Sofa",
      "answers": [

        "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo..."   
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "timeLimit": 45
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-02T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```
